                A few words about my education and work experience
              </h2>
              <p>
                Once my brother, who is a successful programmer now, said that
                linguists may become excellent coders and QAs, but I thought
                that it’s definitely not my cup of tea. So, I chose another
                path. Now I’m 35 years old, and I’m an Associate Professor at
                the Language Training Department of the National University of
                Civil Protection of Ukraine (Kharkiv). I joined the department
                in 2012 after getting my Master’s degrees in Ukrainian Philology
                and English translation and PhD in Ukrainian literature. I also
                has been successfully working as a translator, editor and
                proofreader for main Kharkiv publishing houses for the last 15
                years. In 2017 I passed FCE and proved C1 level (my total score
                was 181). From June 2022 I has been working as a remote
                translator for Digi Media Ltd. Also now I’m on a childcare leave
                until my daughter reaches the age of 3, and I want to use the
                free time as much effective as possible and gain new
                professional knowledge and skills. I understand that I’ve
                reached my ceiling in career growth and I ready to try a new
                path. Furthermore, I believe that it’s a right decision due to
                the crisis caused by the war. And I’m sure that my inspiration,
                industriousness, openness to new, accuracy, mindfulness and
                analytical skills will help me to become a good specialist in
                the field of IT. That’s why the grant is a great opportunity for
                me, and I find the course program very interesting.
