              Once my brother, who is a successful programmer now, said that
              linguists may become excellent coders and QAs, but I thought that
              it’s definitely not my cup of tea. So, I chose another path. Now
              I’m 35 years old, and I’m an Associate Professor at the Language
              Training Department of the National University of Civil Protection
              of Ukraine (Kharkiv). I joined the department in 2012 after
              getting my Master’s degrees in Philology and English language
              translation and PhD in Ukrainian literature. I also has been
              successfully working as a translator, editor and proofreader for
              main Kharkiv publishing houses for the last 15 years. In 2017 I
              passed FCE and proved C1 level (my total score was 181).

              Now I’m on a childcare leave until my daughter reaches the age of
              3, and I want to use the free time as much effective as possible
              and gain new professional knowledge and skills. I understand that
              I’ve reached my ceiling in career growth and I ready to try a new
              path. Furthermore, I believe that it’s a right decision due to the
              crisis caused by the war. And I’m sure that my inspiration,
              industriousness, openness to new, accuracy, mindfulness and
              analytical skills will help me to become a good specialist in the
              field of IT. That’s why the grant is a great opportunity for me,
              and I find the course program very interesting.
